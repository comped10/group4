									<p>TikTok, created by <strong>Zhang Yiming</strong>-founder of Chinese tech giant ByteDance, is the  most popular and downloaded social media platform from 2021 to 2022. It is a video-sharing application that allows users to produce, watch, and share short-form videos ranging from 15 seconds to 3 minutes. Most individuals utilize the said platform for entertainment, but some use it as a source of income by collaborating with small to big businesses and producing videos to promote them. Amateur and professional users of the site are given a chance to express their creativity through the use of filters, stickers, voiceovers, sound effects, and background music. Although users may still watch TikTok videos through the web app, it is primarily mobile-based.</p>

									<p>TikTok is a widely used app worldwide with recorded 1 billion used every day since as early 2022,TikTok also hold headquarter or offices inBeijing, LA, Moscow, Mumbai, Seoul & Tokyo. Available in less than 160 different market. This app also doesn’t get the majorities vote especially in the United States but TikTok still manage to go its way up to its popularity.</p>

										<h3>Why are people using the platform?</h3>
									</header>

									<p>Individuals engage in this platform to entertain themselves, communicate with  others, share their knowledge through creating content, do business or earn money, relieve stress, and shortly escape from reality. And although most of it is for positive causes, TikTok still seemingly has a negative impact on society. One instance is how TikTok correlates with the mental health issues of its users, particularly young women. The majority of famous female influencers on the platform have skinny, fit bodies. These females frequently flaunt their restricted, nutritious diets and rigorous exercise routines, causing the viewers of these kinds of posts to be compelled to adopt these behaviors if they want to "have a good physique" as well. In addition, a lot of female users of the app discuss their experiences with eating disorders and mental problems. These subjects may be educational and demonstrate that others have experienced similar difficulties to your own, but they may also be quite alarming. </p>

									<p>Another instance is how popularity on social media platforms is considered to be the basis of social status. It is not a secret how we humans love the idea of being noticed and acknowledged. Hence it is not surprising to discover how a simple number of followers, likes, or comments is becoming a lifeline for some. It is as if the end of their ladder to success is exceeding the number of engagements of the ones they look up to. The scripted feedback on dangerous products as many users are equivalent to many possible consumers. Numerous brands promote their obscure products by using famous influencers to gain recognition, and in exchange for it are some cash or free products. Most of these promotional videos come with scripted feedback created by the brand. These techniques are surely profitable for both the brand and influencers, but the downside will fall to the viewers or the possible consumers. Vulnerable and impulsive viewers/buyers might receive less than what they expected, or worse, obtain a negative effect on themselves. </p>

										<h3>Personalized content for exploiting user attention</h3>
									</header>

									<p>
										The personalized feed of quirky short videos based on the user's interacted likes,  bookmarks, shares, and comments made the platform addictive and engaging. Not to mention having the endless scrolling feature similar to FaceBook, which made it easy to navigate and hard to stop.

										With so much engagement that can be called addiction, this can lead to an unhealthy lifestyle, especially for children. It can affect their studies, relationships with themselves and others, or worse, their mental health. There is always a saying that:
