										<h3>Importance of Terms and Conditions</h3>
									</header>

									<ol>
										<li><strong>Covers all areas</strong></li>
										<p>T&C discusses not only liability but also the platform's overview. It states needed commercial terms such as data agreement</p> 
										<li><strong>Certainty</strong></li>

										<li><strong>Compliance</strong></li>
										<p>With platforms dealing with user data collection, a privacy policy should be included in the T&C as required by the law. The T&C is also used as a legal requirement before any action between the user and service provider is done. </p>

										<h3>Privacy policy introduction</h3>

									<p>Next to the platform's terms and conditions, one of its most significant parts is the privacy policy.Tiktok provides a very personal user experience due to its detailed process of data collection inside and outside app usage.
